<h2>Objective & Scope :</h2>
<b>
‚òëÔ∏èObjective: The primary objective of this project is to use SQL (Structured Query Language) to analyze a relational database of pizza sales data.<br>
The analysis will cover key business metrics, product performance, and temporal trends to provide actionable insights for optimizing inventory, pricing, and promotional strategies.<br>
‚òëÔ∏èScope: The project addresses 12 distinct analytical questions, organized into three tiers of complexity: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.<br>
It requires joining four core tables: orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types.<br>

<h2>Key Analytical Areasüìä:</h2>
<b>
1. Sales & Revenue Tracking<br>
2. Product Performance<br>
3. Temporal Analysis<br>
4. Contribution & Segmentation<br>
